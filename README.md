# image-carousel
The Odin Project JS practice


Explanation of my version of an image carousel (how the code works):
-Basic Overview-
A strip of images is created and styled using HTML/CSS with a 'picture frame' being positioned at the center of the web page. All images are hidden except for the visible image that is currently behind the 'picture frame'. The image strip is moved around (left and right) by using JS, thus changing what image is visible at any given time. 


-Features-
The image carousel has multiple features/functionality.

Feature 1: Clickable buttons that move the image strip left and right.
Feature 2: Clickable button that automatically advances the image strip and another button to stop the auto-advance/timeout.
Feature 3: Navigation dots. Clickable buttons that serve as a visible point of reference as to which image the user is being shown at any given time. Furthermore, there is a feature to click the dots to change to the corresponding image. For example, clicking dot 3 will show image 3 in the center/picture frame.
